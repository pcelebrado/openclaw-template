# OpenClaw Core — Railway Template

An **OpenClaw** wrapper service for Railway. Packages OpenClaw Gateway + Control UI
with a browser-based setup wizard for zero-CLI deployment.

## What you get

- **OpenClaw Gateway + Control UI** — served at `/` and `/openclaw`
- **Setup Wizard** at `/setup` — password-protected browser onboarding
- **Persistent state** via Railway Volume — config, credentials, and memory survive redeploys
- **Backup / restore** — export and import from `/setup`
- **Debug console** — allowlisted safe commands for troubleshooting without SSH
- **Multi-provider model support** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, OpenRouter, Moonshot, and more
- **Channel support** — Telegram, Discord, Slack configured via wizard

## Architecture

This is **Service B** in the OpenClaw 3-service Railway deployment:

```
Browser → [web] (public) → [core] (internal, this service)
                                    ├── OpenClaw Gateway
                                    ├── QMD (vector search)
                                    └── Setup wizard + debug console
```

- This service is **internal only** — no public HTTP exposure.
- The web service calls core endpoints with `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN`.
- All `/internal/*` endpoints require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

## Deploy on Railway

1. Create a new Railway project from this repo
2. Add a **Volume** mounted at `/data`
3. Set environment variables:
   - `SETUP_PASSWORD` — password for the `/setup` wizard and Control UI
   - `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=/data/.openclaw` (recommended)
   - `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR=/data/workspace` (recommended)
   - `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` — auth token (auto-generated if not set)
   - `INTERNAL_SERVICE_TOKEN` — must match the web service value
4. **Disable Public Networking** — this service is internal only
5. Deploy
6. Complete setup via the web service's admin panel or direct internal access

## Build

The Dockerfile builds OpenClaw from source (pinned to a release tag via `OPENCLAW_GIT_REF`)
and packages it with the Node.js wrapper.

```bash
docker build -t openclaw-core .
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e PORT=8080 \
  -e SETUP_PASSWORD=test \
  -e OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR=/data/.openclaw \
  -e OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR=/data/workspace \
  -v $(pwd)/.tmpdata:/data \
  openclaw-core
```

## Persistence (Railway volume)

Railway containers have an ephemeral filesystem. Only the mounted volume at `/data` persists.

What persists:
- **OpenClaw config and credentials** — `/data/.openclaw/`
- **Agent workspace** — `/data/workspace/`
- **Node global tools** — `/data/npm/`, `/data/pnpm/`
- **Python venvs** — create under `/data/`

What does **not** persist:
- `apt-get install` packages (use bootstrap.sh for these)

### Bootstrap hook

If `/data/workspace/bootstrap.sh` exists, the wrapper runs it on startup before
starting the gateway. Use this to initialize persistent install prefixes or venvs.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `disconnected (1008): pairing required` | No device approved yet | Use debug console: `openclaw devices list` then `approve <id>` |
| `unauthorized: gateway token mismatch` | Token mismatch between UI and gateway | Re-run setup or set both tokens to same value in config |
| `502 Bad Gateway` | Gateway can't start or can't bind | Ensure volume at `/data`, check Railway logs |
| Build OOM | Insufficient memory | Use Railway plan with 2GB+ memory |
